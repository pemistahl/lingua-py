        By default, Lingua returns the most likely language for a given

        same in more than one language. The word 'prologue', for instance,
        is both a valid English and French word. Lingua would output either
        English or French which might be wrong in the given context.
        For cases like that, it is possible to specify a minimum relative
        distance that the logarithmized and summed up probabilities for
        each possible language have to satisfy.

        Be aware that the distance between the language probabilities is
        dependent on the length of the input text. The longer the input
        text, the larger the distance between the languages. So if you
        want to classify very short text phrases, do not set the minimum
        relative distance too high. Otherwise you will get most results
        returned as None which is the return value for cases where

        beneficial to preload all language models into memory to avoid
